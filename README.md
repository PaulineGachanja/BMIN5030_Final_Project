## **DETERMINING THE CAUSAL LINKS BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE TIMING AND METABOLIC RISK: A BIDIRECTIONAL MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION STUDY**

## **Overview**

This project uses Mendelian Randomization (MR) to investigate the bidirectional relationship between reproductive timing, particularly age at menarche (AAM) and age of natural menopause (ANM) with Type 2 Diabetes and Lipids (HDL, LDL, Triglycerides and Total cholesterol). The goal is to determine whether we can use reproductive timing as a diagnostic tool to predict Type 2 Diabetes risk and lipid levels or vice-versa.
