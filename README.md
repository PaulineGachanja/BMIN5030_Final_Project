## **Reproductive Timing and Cardiometabolic risk: Bidirectional Mendelian Randomization of Age at Menarche and Natural Menopause**

## **Overview**

This project uses Mendelian Randomization to investigate (MR) to investigate the bidirectional relationship between reproductive timing, particularly age at menarche (AAM) and age of natural menopause (ANM). The goal is to determine whether reproductive timing contributes to cardiometabolic disease risk or is itself influenced by underlying poor cardiometabolic health outcomes.
